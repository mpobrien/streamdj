    <h3>My audio is skipping! :(</h3>

    <h3>My song got skipped/didn't play! :( WTF?</h3>
      <p>
       Poor guy! A couple things could've happened - it's possible that your song was a corrupted file or an unsupported format - we're working hard on making it work with any file you throw at it, but it could still happen. If you REALLY want to play the song, you could run it throught the iTunes mp3 converter (info here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1550) which ensures a good result. You should be able to play almost any mp3, m4a, or wma file without a problem.
